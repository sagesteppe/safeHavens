\arguments{
\item{populations_sf}{sf/tibble/data.frame. Coordinates of populations to be clustered. Must contain POINT geometries.}

\item{base_raster}{SpatRaster. Base raster for the study area. Provides template geometry and resolution.}

\item{buffer_dist}{Numeric. Distance to buffer population points to assign likely occupied cells (optional; ignored if using \code{sample_population_cells} directly).}

\item{planar_proj}{Numeric. EPSG code used to project \code{populations_sf} for buffering operations.}

\item{n_points}{Numeric (defaults to 50). Number of points to sample for creating the surface. Increasing points drastically increases compute time.}

\item{resistance_surface}{SpatRaster. Optional pre-computed resistance raster. If provided, the raster-building arguments are ignored.}

\item{oceans}{SpatRaster. Binary (0/1) raster for ocean cells. Used to increase movement cost.}

\item{lakes}{SpatRaster. Binary (0/1) raster for lakes.}

\item{rivers}{SpatRaster. Binary (0/1) raster for rivers.}

\item{tri}{SpatRaster. Continuous raster of topographic roughness (TRI). Used to increase cost in mountainous terrain.}

\item{habitat}{SpatRaster. Continuous raster of habitat suitability. Low values increase cost.}

\item{w_ocean}{Numeric. Weight applied to oceans (default 2000).}

\item{w_lakes}{Numeric. Weight applied to lakes (default 200).}

\item{w_rivers}{Numeric. Weight applied to rivers (default 20).}

\item{w_tri}{Numeric. Weight applied to TRI (default 1).}

\item{w_habitat}{Numeric. Weight applied to habitat suitability (default 1).}

\item{graph_method}{Character. One of \code{"delaunay"} or \code{"complete"}. Defines the spatial graph connecting population points.
Delauney produces a sparser graph can deal with higher \code{n}, 'complete' is more computationally intensive and n > 175 take considerable time.}

\item{ibr_method}{Character. Currently only \code{"leastcost"}.}

A list with the following elements:

\description{
Creates a matrix, and supporting data structures, of a Isolation by Distance distances using a simplified framework.
Given a raster surface parameterizing resistance to movement (e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, topographic roughness, or habitat suitability), this function calculates pairwise landscape resistance among populations and identifies clusters of populations that are least isolated from each other.

The function can internally build a resistance raster, but for performance across multiple species, it is recommended to provide pre-computed surfaces.
Resistance is treated as isotropic (no slope directionality).
Clustering is based on pairwise IBR distances and can be visualized or used to guide sampling schemes.
